Errors: (respective screenshots in 4.2 bugs folder)

#1
instruction: 'In the documentation page for the Meetup API, it explains that authorization codes can be obtained by way of the following URL:

“https://secure.meetup.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY&response_type=code&redirect_uri=YOUR_CONSUMER_REDIRECT_URI”''

I input this address into Chrome, meetups asked for authorization and I clicked Allow. But afterwards it gave me a 404 error. The exact text I used was:

https://secure.meetup.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=3dssascu6mej4fuptij43jdbh4&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://bxchang04.github.io/meetup

NOTE: my website URL https://bxchang04.github.io/meetup deploys my React page with no errors, so I'm not sure why this step is generating an error.

please refer to screenshots in 4.2 bugs folder.

#2
instruction:
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Make sure you replace ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with your own credentials!

result: command launched, but did not complete. please refer to screenshot '4.2 bugs/aws update did not complete.png'

#3
issue: upon running npm install axios, auth-server is generated with only 3 files instead of 5. please refer to

#4
instruction: Back in your terminal (and still in your project directory), use the command:

serverless invoke local --function getAccessToken

issue: serverless invoke function leads to no response. screenshot attached. I assume this error and every error that follows are caused by issues 1-3 above not resolving.

#5
'Deploying Your Function
Once you’ve finished writing and testing your function, you can deploy it to see if it executes correctly in the real world. Back in your terminal, run the following command:

serverless deploy

This command deploys your function to AWS Lambda using the information provided in the “serverless.yml” config file. Once it’s run, you should see the following deployment information in your terminal:'

issue: unintended behavior in my app. Assume this is caused by requisite issues above.
